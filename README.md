project-paths
=============

Access file paths from `pyproject.toml`

> Thanks to [@Madoshakalaka](https://github.com/madoshakalaka) for the idea!

```toml
# pyproject.toml
[tool.project-paths]
readme = "README.md"
```

```python
# app.py
from project_paths import paths

# paths.readme is a pathlib.Path object:
print(paths.readme.read_text())
```

Install
-------

    pip install project-paths


Usage
-----

Does your application have a bunch of configurable file paths? Do you
wish you just had one place to configure list them all?

### Add paths to `[tool.project-paths]`

With this module, define your paths in your `pyproject.toml` file under
the `[tool.project-paths]` table:

```toml
[tool.project-paths]
docs = "path/to/my/docs"
settings = "path/to/my/settings.py"
config = "/opt/path/to/my/config
# Add as many paths as you want!
```

Anything string defined with `[tool.project-paths]` will be made
available. Relative paths are relative to `pyproject.toml`.

### Access paths using `project_paths.paths.<path name>`

Now you can access all the paths listed in `pyproject.toml` with
`project_paths.paths`. Every path is returned as
a [`pathlib.Path`][pathlib] object:

```python
from project_paths import paths

print(paths.docs.glob("*.md"))
assert paths.config.exists()
exec(paths.settings.read_text())
# Or anything you want!
```
